Brand (1865) stated sharply and vividly the necessity of following one's private conscience and 'being oneself'. It created an immediate sensation and was hailed by Strindberg as 'the voice of a Savonarola'. Emperor and Galilean (1873), which Ibsen referred to as his masterpiece, is both his farewell to the epic drama and the forerunner of his great naturalistic prose plays that were to burst on the nineteenth century.</p><p>Michael Meyer's translations are 'crisp and cobweb-free, purged of verbal Victoriana' (Kenneth Tynan)<br /></p><br /></div>",Drama / European / General,,2017-10-15 1:38:36,2017-10-15 1:38:36,ca49538689dcf78adf59790c8957f72c
2,"McCourt, Frank",Tis,684865742,Simon & Schuster,2000-08-28,0,0,Frank McCourt (2),368,,17,Paperback,"The sequel to Frank McCourt's memoir of his Irish Catholic boyhood, <i>Angela's Ashes</i>, picks up the story in October 1949, upon his arrival in America. Though he was born in New York, the family had returned to Ireland due to poor prospects in the United States. Now back on American soil, this awkward 19-year-old, with his ""pimply face, sore eyes, and bad teeth,"" has little in common with the healthy, self-assured college students he sees on the subway and dreams of joining in the classroom. Initially, his American experience is as harrowing as his impoverished youth in Ireland, including two of the grimmest Christmases ever described in literature. McCourt views the U.S. through the same sharp eye and with the same dark humor that distinguished his first memoir: race prejudice, casual cruelty, and dead-end jobs weigh on his spirits as he searches for a way out. A glimpse of hope comes from the army, where he acquires some white-collar skills, and from New York University, which admits him without a high school diploma. But the journey toward his position teaching creative writing at Stuyvesant High School is neither quick nor easy. Fortunately, McCourt's openness to every variety of human emotion and longing remains exceptional; even the most damaged, difficult people he encounters are richly rendered individuals with whom the reader can't help but feel uncomfortable kinship. The magical prose, with its singing Irish cadences, brings grandeur and beauty to the most sorrowful events, including the final scene, set in a Limerick graveyard. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>",Biography & Autobiography / Educators,English,2017-10-15 1:40:30,2017-10-15 1:40:30,3ddb0da4ad1911d76f8e21565502ad5d

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom’s protective Wall. To the south, the king’s powers are failing—his most trusted adviser dead under mysterious circumstances and his enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly summoned to serve as the king’s new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the kingdom itself.<br /><br />Sweeping from a harsh land of cold to a summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, A Game of Thrones tells a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens. Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; a child is lost in the twilight between life and death; and a determined woman undertakes a treacherous journey to protect all she holds dear.

Now comes the first biography of this towering figure in almost fifty years--a book that captures his life in all its heroism, idealism, and ambivalent, ambiguous humanity. <br /> In <em>A River Running West</em>, Donald Worster, one of our leading Western historians, tells the story of Powell's great adventures and describes his historical significance with compelling clarity and skill. Worster paints a vivid portrait of how this man emerged from the early nineteenth-century world of immigrants, fervent religion, and rough-and-tumble rural culture, and barely survived the Civil War battle at Shiloh. The heart of Worster's biography is Powell's epic journey down the Colorado in 1869, a tale of harrowing experiences, lethal accidents, and breathtaking discoveries. After years in the region collecting rocks and fossils and learning to speak the local Native American languages, Powell returned to Washington as an eloquent advocate for the West, one of America's first and most influential conservationists.

Bestselling author Peter Sims found that all of them have achieved breakthrough results by methodically taking small, experimental steps in order to discover and develop new ideas. Rather than believing they have to start with a big idea or plan a whole project out in advance, trying to foresee the final outcome, they make a series of little bets about what might be a good direction, learning from lots of little failures and from small but highly significant wins that allow them to happen upon unexpected avenues and arrive at extraordinary outcomes. <br />          Based on deep and extensive research, including more than 200 interviews with leading innovators, Sims discovered that productive, creative thinkers and doers—from Ludwig van Beethoven to Thomas Edison and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos—practice a key set of simple but ingenious experimental methods—such as failing quickly to learn fast, tapping into the genius of play, and engaging in highly immersed observation—that free their minds, opening them up to making unexpected connections and perceiving invaluable insights. These methods also unshackle them from the constraints of overly analytical thinking and linear problem solving that our education places so much emphasis on, as well as from the fear of failure, all of which thwart so many of us in trying to be more innovative.  <br />             Reporting on a fascinating range of research, from the psychology of creative blocks to the influential Silicon Valley–based field of design thinking, Sims offers engaging and wonderfully illuminating accounts of breakthrough innovators at work, including how Hewlett-Packard stumbled onto the breakaway success of the first hand-held calculator; the remarkable storyboarding process at Pixar films that has been the key to their unbroken streak of box office successes; the playful discovery process by which Frank Gehry arrived at his critically acclaimed design for Disney Hall; the aha revelation that led Amazon to pursue its wildly successful affiliates program; and the U.S. Army’s ingenious approach to counterinsurgency operations that led to the dramatic turnaround in Iraq.  <br />             Fast paced and as entertaining as it is illuminating, <i>Little Bets</i> offers a whole new way of thinking about how to break away from the narrow strictures of the methods of analyzing and problem solving we were all taught in school and unleash our untapped creative powers. ",,English,2017-10-15 16:14:33,2017-10-15 16:14:33,654b095a53510e869c53b1125c2de23c

""And yet, in our memory, what character is more alive?""--Widely regarded as the world's first modern novel, Don Quixote chronicles the famous picaresque adventures of the noble knight-errant Don Quixote de La Mancha &amp; his faithful squire, Sancho Panza, as they travel through sixteenth-century Spain. This Modern Library edition presents the acclaimed Samuel Putnam translation of the epic tale, complete with notes, variant readings, &amp; an Introduction by the translator.<br /> The debt owed to Cervantes by literature is immense. From Milan Kundera: ""Cervantes is the founder of the Modern Era...The novelist need answer to no one but Cervantes.""<br /> Lionel Trilling observed: ""It can be said that all prose fiction is a variation on the theme of Don Quixote."" <br /> Vladmir Nabokov wrote: ""Don Quixote is greater today than he was in Cervantes's womb. [He] looms so wonderfully above the skyline of literature, a gaunt giant on a lean nag, that the book lives &amp; will live through [his] sheer vitality...He stands for everything that is gentle, forlorn, pure, unselfish &amp; gallant. The parody has become a paragon.""<br /> V. S. Pritchett observed: ""Don Quixote begins as a province, turns into Spain, and ends as a universe...The true spell of Cervantes is that he is a natural magician in pure story-telling.""<br /> The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni &amp; Liveright &amp; eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf &amp; Donald Klopfer.

Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. ""World War Z"" is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years. <br /><br /> Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <br /><br /> Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, ""By excluding the human factor, aren't we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn't the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as 'the living dead'?"" <br /><br /> Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission. Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war: <br /><br /> ""I found 'Patient Zero' behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . . His wrists and feet were bound with plastic packing twine. Although he'd rubbed off the skin around his bonds, there was no blood. There was also no blood on his other wounds. . . . He was writhing like an animal; a gag muffled his growls. At first the villagers tried to hold me back. They warned me not to touch him, that he was 'cursed.' I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy's skin was . . . cold and gray . . . I could find neither his heartbeat nor his pulse."" -- Dr. Kwang Jingshu, Greater Chongqing, United Federation of China<br /><br />""'Shock and Awe'? Perfect name. . . . But what if the enemy can't be shocked and awed? Not just won't, but biologically can't That's what happened that day outside New York City, that's the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war. The fact that we couldn't shock and awe Zack boomeranged right back in our faces and actually allowed Zack to shock and awe us They're not afraid No matter what we do, no matter how many we kill, they will never, ever be afraid "" -- Todd Wainio, former U.S. Army infantryman and veteran of the Battle of Yonkers<br /><br />""Two hundred million zombies. Who can even visualize that type of number, let alone combat it? . . . For the first time in history, we faced an enemy that was actively waging total war. They had no limits of endurance. They would never negotiate, never surrender.

McLellan &amp; other scholars believe ""the actual drafting of The Communist Manifesto was done exclusively by Marx."" The text itself claims to have been sketched by a group of Communists from various countries gathered in London.<br /> The Manifesto's initial publication, in 1848 in London, was in German. The 1st English translation was produced by Helen MacFarlane in 1850. The Manifesto went thru a number of editions from 1872 to 1890. New prefaces were written by Marx &amp; Engels for the 1872 German edition, the 1882 Russian edition, the 1883 German edition &amp; the 1888 English edition. This edition, translated by Samuel Moore with Engels' assistance, has been the commonly used English text since.<br /> Some recent English editions, such as Phil Gasper's annotated ""road map"" (Haymarket Books, '06), have used a slightly modified text in response to criticisms of the Moore translation made by Hal Draper in his The Adventures of the Communist Manifesto (Center for Socialist History, '94).<br /> The Manifesto is divided into an introduction, three substantive sections &amp; a conclusion.<br /> The introduction begins with the comparison of communism to a spectre, claiming that across Europe communism is feared, but not understood. Thus communists ought to make their views known with a manifesto:<br />""A spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of Communism. All the Powers of old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope &amp; Czar, Metternich &amp; Guizot, French Radicals &amp; German police-spies.

This volume represents the first time those lectures have been published.<br /><br />Lord Robbins (1898-1984) was a remarkably accomplished thinker, writer, and public figure. He made important contributions to economic theory, methodology, and policy analysis, directed the economic section of Winston Churchill's War Cabinet, and served as chairman of the <i>Financial Times</i>. As a historian of economic ideas, he ranks with Joseph Schumpeter and Jacob Viner as one of the foremost scholars of the century. These lectures, delivered at the London School of Economics between 1979 and 1981 and tape-recorded by Robbins's grandson, display his mastery of the intellectual history of economics, his infectious enthusiasm for the subject, and his eloquence and incisive wit. They cover a broad chronological range, beginning with Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas, focusing extensively on Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus and the classicals, and finishing with a discussion of moderns and marginalists from Marx to Alfred Marshall. Robbins takes a varied and inclusive approach to intellectual history. As he says in his first lecture: ""I shall go my own sweet way--sometimes talk about doctrine, sometimes talk about persons, sometimes talk about periods."" The lectures are united by Robbins's conviction that it is impossible to understand adequately contemporary institutions and social sciences without understanding the ideas behind their development.<br /><br />Authoritative yet accessible, combining the immediacy of the spoken word with Robbins's exceptional talent for clear, well-organized exposition, this volume will be welcomed by anyone interested in the intellectual origins of the modern world.",Business & Economics / Education,,2017-10-16 2:11:25,2017-10-16 2:11:25,8d9fe0fabe93e81f119c208f9dbaddf2

Here is the continuation of her fascinating story.<br /><br />In 1984, Marjane flees fundamentalism and the war with Iraq to begin a new life in Vienna. Once there, she faces the trials of adolescence far from her friends and family, and while she soon carves out a place for herself among a group of fellow outsiders, she continues to struggle for a sense of belonging.<br /><br />Finding that she misses her home more than she can stand, Marjane returns to Iran after graduation. Her difficult homecoming forces her to confront the changes both she and her country have undergone in her absence and her shame at what she perceives as her failure in Austria. Marjane allows her past to weigh heavily on her until she finds some like-minded friends, falls in love, and begins studying art at a university. However, the repression and state-sanctioned chauvinism eventually lead her to question whether she can have a future in Iran.<br /><br />As funny and poignant as its predecessor, <i>Persepolis 2</i> is another clear-eyed and searing condemnation of the human cost of fundamentalism.

It is, as <b>Michael Hardt</b> and <b>Antonio Negri</b> demonstrate in this bold work, the new political order of globalization. It is easy to recognize the contemporary economic, cultural, and legal transformations taking place across the globe but difficult to understand them. Hardt and Negri contend that they should be seen in line with our historical understanding of Empire as a universal order that accepts no boundaries or limits. Their book shows how this emerging Empire is fundamentally different from the imperialism of European dominance and capitalist expansion in previous eras. Rather, today's Empire draws on elements of U.S. constitutionalism, with its tradition of hybrid identities and expanding frontiers. <i>Empire</i> identifies a radical shift in concepts that form the philosophical basis of modern politics, concepts such as sovereignty, nation, and people. Hardt and Negri link this philosophical transformation to cultural and economic changes in postmodern society--to new forms of racism, new conceptions of identity and difference, new networks of communication and control, and new paths of migration. They also show how the power of transnational corporations and the increasing predominance of postindustrial forms of labor and production help to define the new imperial global order.

In his challenging Introduction, ""Gandhi and the One-Eyed Giant,"" Merton emphasizes the importance of action rather than mere pacifism as a central component of non-violence, and illustrates how the foundations of Gandhi's universal truths are linked to traditional Hindu Dharma, the Greek philosophers, and the teachings of Christ and Thomas Aquinas.<br /><br /> Educated as a Westerner in South Africa, it was Gandhi's desire to set aside the caste system as well as his political struggles in India which led him to discover the dynamic power of non-cooperation.

The findings will surprise many readers and, quite frankly, upset others.<br /><br />The Challenge<br />Built to Last, the defining management study of the nineties, showed how great companies triumph over time and how long-term sustained performance can be engineered into the DNA of an enterprise from the very beginning. <br /><br />But what about the company that is not born with great DNA? How can good companies, mediocre companies, even bad companies achieve enduring greatness? <br /><br />The Study<br />For years, this question preyed on the mind of Jim Collins. Are there companies that defy gravity and convert long-term mediocrity or worse into long-term superiority? And if so, what are the universal distinguishing characteristics that cause a company to go from good to great?<br /><br />The Standards<br />Using tough benchmarks, Collins and his research team identified a set of elite companies that made the leap to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years. How great? After the leap, the good-to-great companies generated cumulative stock returns that beat the general stock market by an average of seven times in fifteen years, better than twice the results delivered by a composite index of the world's greatest companies, including Coca-Cola, Intel, General Electric, and Merck. <br /><br />The Comparisons<br />The research team contrasted the good-to-great companies with a carefully selected set of comparison companies that failed to make the leap from good to great.

Do we have a special place, even a destiny in the universe? Where are we going, and perhaps, the most difficult question of all, ""Why?""<br /><br />In <em>The Meaning of Human Existence</em>, his most philosophical work to date, Pulitzer Prize–winning biologist Edward O. Wilson grapples with these and other existential questions, examining what makes human beings supremely different from all other species. Searching for meaning in what Nietzsche once called ""the rainbow colors"" around the outer edges of knowledge and imagination, Wilson takes his readers on a journey, in the process bridging science and philosophy to create a twenty-first-century treatise on human existence—from our earliest inception to a provocative look at what the future of mankind portends.<br /><br />Continuing his groundbreaking examination of our ""Anthropocene Epoch,"" which he began with <em>The Social Conquest of Earth</em>, described by the <em>New York Times</em> as ""a sweeping account of the human rise to domination of the biosphere,"" here Wilson posits that we, as a species, now know enough about the universe and ourselves that we can begin to approach questions about our place in the cosmos and the meaning of intelligent life in a systematic, indeed, in a testable way.<br /><br />Once criticized for a purely mechanistic view of human life and an overreliance on genetic predetermination, Wilson presents in <em>The Meaning of Human Existence</em> his most expansive and advanced theories on the sovereignty of human life, recognizing that, even though the human and the spider evolved similarly, the poet's sonnet is wholly different from the spider's web. Whether attempting to explicate ""The Riddle of the Human Species,"" ""Free Will,"" or ""Religion""; warning of ""The Collapse of Biodiversity""; or even creating a plausible ""Portrait of E.T.,"" Wilson does indeed believe that humanity holds a special position in the known universe.<br /><br />The human epoch that began in biological evolution and passed into pre-, then recorded, history is now more than ever before in our hands. Yet alarmed that we are about to abandon natural selection by redesigning biology and human nature as we wish them, Wilson soberly concludes that advances in science and technology bring us our greatest moral dilemma since God stayed the hand of Abraham.",,English,2017-10-17 18:23:19,2017-10-17 18:23:19,174df154922a58039a5aa7ec9c6f6ac9

Why are we here? Why is there something rather than nothing? What is the nature of reality? Why are the laws of nature so finely tuned as to allow for the existence of beings like ourselves? And, finally, is the apparent “grand design” of our universe evidence of a benevolent creator who set things in motion—or does science offer another explanation? <br /><br />The most fundamental questions about the origins of the universe and of life itself, once the province of philosophy, now occupy the territory where scientists, philosophers, and theologians meet—if only to disagree. In their new book, Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present the most recent scientific thinking about the mysteries of the universe, in nontechnical language marked by both brilliance and simplicity. <br /><br />In <i>The Grand Design</i> they explain that according to quantum theory, the cosmos does not have just a single existence or history, but rather that every possible history of the universe exists simultaneously. When applied to the universe as a whole, this idea calls into question the very notion of cause and effect. But the “top-down” approach to cosmology that Hawking and <br /><br />Mlodinow describe would say that the fact that the past takes no definite form means that we create history by observing it, rather than that history creates us. The authors further explain that we ourselves are the product of quantum fluctuations in the very early universe, and show how quantum theory predicts the “multiverse”—the idea that ours is just one of many universes that appeared spontaneously out of nothing, each with different laws of nature.<br /><br />Along the way Hawking and Mlodinow question the conventional concept of reality, posing a “model-dependent” theory of reality as the best we can hope to find.

How and why did it begin? Will it come to an end, and if so, how?<br /><br />Hawking attempts to deal with these questions (and where we might look for answers) using a minimum of technical jargon. Among the topics gracefully covered are gravity, black holes, the Big Bang, the nature of time and physicists' search for a grand unifying theory. <br /><br />This is deep science; the concepts are so vast (or so tiny) that they cause mental vertigo while reading, and one can't help but marvel at Hawking's ability to synthesize this difficult subject for people not used to thinking about things like alternate dimensions. The journey is certainly worth taking for as Hawking says, the reward of understanding the universe may be a glimpse of “the mind of God”.<br />(From Hawking.org.uk)<br /><br /><br /><i>A Brief History of Time</i>, published in 1988, was a landmark volume in science writing and in world-wide acclaim and popularity, with more than 9 million copies in print globally. The original edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the ensuing years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic world—observations that have confirmed many of Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book. Now a decade later, this edition updates the chapters throughout to document those advances, and also includes an entirely new chapter on Wormholes and Time Travel and a new introduction.

Hawking's wit, directness of style, and absence of pomp characterize all of them, whether he is remembering his first experience at nursery school; calling for adequate education in science that will enable the public to play its part in making informed decisions on matters such as nuclear disarmament; exploring the origins or the future of the universe; or reflecting on the history of ""A Brief History Of Time.

Tolkien's imaginative writing, a work that he could not publish in his lifetime because it grew with him. Its origins stretch back to a time long before THE HOBBIT. But THE HOBBIT was caught up in what Tolkien called ""the branching acquisitive theme"" he began in THE SILMARILLION, and eventually THE LORD OF THE RINGS emerged from this as well.<br /> Tolkien considered THE SILMARILLION his most important work, and, though it was published last and posthumously, this great collection of tales and legends clearly sets the stage for all his other works. This is the story of the creation of the world and the happenings of the First Age, the ancient drama to which the characters in THE LORD OF THE RINGS look back and in whose events some of them, such as Elrond and Galadriel, took part.<br /> The three Silmarils were jewels created by Feanor, the most gifted of the Elves. Within them was imprisoned the Light of the Two Trees of Valinor before the Trees themselves were destroyed by Morgoth, the first Dark Lord. Thereafter, the unsullied Light of Valinor lived on only in the Silmarils, but they were seized by Morgoth and set in his crown, which was guarded in the impenetrable fortress of Angband in the north of Middle-earth. THE SILMARILLION is the history of the rebellion of Feanor and his kindred against the gods, their exile from Valinor and return to Middle-earth, and their war, hopeless despite all their heroism, against the great Enemy.<br /> The book includes several other, shorter works in addition to THE SILMARILLION. Preceding it are ""The Ainulindale,"" a myth of the Creation, and ""The Valaquenta,"" in which the nature and power of the gods is set forth. After THE SILMARILLION comes ""The Akallabeth,"" a tale of the downfall of the kingdom of Numeno, and finally ""Of the Rings of Power,"" the connecting link to THE LORD OF THE RINGS.<br /> This second edition features a number of minor textual corrections along with a letter written by J.R.R.

Following up on his groundbreaking work with David Hall in <i>Thinking Through Confucius</i>, Roger Ames has teamed up with Henry Rosemont to put theory into practice, portraying Confucius in light of his communitarian leanings. In a translation that comes off as surprisingly relaxed and colloquial, gone are the adherence to strict rules of propriety and righteous moralizing. Confucius has long been the victim of a certain unwitting Christianization, having been interpreted through the lens of Western philosophical assumptions. Ames and Rosemont scale away these assumptions, revealing a flexible and subtle thinker whose ideas of how to live well in a harmonious community have much to offer a fragmented society tied to reductive atomism and the exclusive exaltation of the individual. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>",Philosophy / Eastern,,2017-10-24 16:24:30,2017-10-24 16:24:30,4f16163bc84725cacdb96a76542b5a9e

Ascending to the imperial throne in A.D. 161, Aurelius found his reign beset by natural disasters and war. In the wake of these challenges, he set down a series of private reflections, outlining a philosophy of commitment to virtue above pleasure and tranquility above happiness.<br />Reflecting the emperor's own noble and self-sacrificing code of conduct, this eloquent and moving work draws and enriches the tradition of Stoicism, which stressed the search for inner peace and ethical certainty in an apparently chaotic world. Serenity was to be achieved by emulating in one's personal conduct the underlying orderliness and lawfulness of nature. And in the face of inevitable pain, loss, and death — the suffering at the core of life — Aurelius counsels stoic detachment from the things that are beyond one's control and a focus on one's own will and perception.<br />Presented here in a specially modernized version of the classic George Long translation, this updated and revised edition is easily accessible to contemporary readers.

The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he's starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts . Living with his son's family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access--through nodes designed into <i>smart</i> clothes--and to see the digital context--through <i>smart</i> contact lenses. <br /><br />With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination. <br /><br />In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert's son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot. <br /><br />As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected.

Money does not drive Mr. Rosewater (or the corrupt lawyer who tries to shape the Rosewater fortune) so much as outrage at the human condition. <br /><br />The novel was adapted for a 1979 Alan Menken musical.

Mit dem Bemerken, »wer zu gehorchen wisse, der wisse auch zu befehlen, und ebenso umgekehrt; der eine Gedanke sei in dem anderen einbegriffen, wie Volk und Führer ineinander einbegriffen seien, aber die Leistung, die äußerst strenge und aufreibende Leistung, sei jedenfalls seine, des Führers und Veranstalters, in welchem der Wille Gehorsam, der Gehorsam Wille werde«, verlockt und verblendet dieser »Typus des Scharlatans, des marktschreierischen Possenreißers« sein Publikum und hypnotisiert es zu einer »trunkenen Auflösung der kritischen Widerstände«. In Mario, dem jungen Kellner, glaubt er, sich steigernd, schließlich ein Opfer gefunden zu haben, das er aufs tiefste demütigen, ja vergewaltigen kann, ohne mit der Würde des Menschen rechnen zu müssen. Wie stark die »politisch-moralische Anspielung, in Worten nirgends ausgesprochen«, aus dieser Erzählung bereits bei ihrem ersten Erscheinen 1930 wirkte, spiegelt sich in Julius Babs Rezension: »Wenn Mussolini etwas von Kunst verstände, müßte er diese Novelle in Italien verbieten lassen.""",,German,2017-10-29 16:07:19,2017-10-29 16:07:19,6dcfca2b9de6a8d99e3e80d836d5def6

Hoffmann entführt den Leser in die Welt des Studenten Nathanaels, der über Briefe in Kontakt mit seinem Freund Lothar steht. In einem dieser Briefe erzählt Nathanael ihm von dem Wetterglashändler Coppola. Dieser sei in Wirklichkeit der teuflische Advokat Coppelius, ein Freund seines Vaters, der an dessen Tod schuld sei. Als Kind sah Nathanael in Coppola den Sandmann, der, wie in einem grausigen Kindermärchen erzählt wird, den Kindern Sand in die Augen streut, bis diese herausfallen. Er sieht in Coppola ein ""böses Prinzip"", das sein Liebesglück mit seiner Verlobten Clara zerstören will. Clara sieht in dieser Vorstellung ein ""Phantom eigenen Ichs"" und kann mit ihrem Glauben an das Gute Nathanaels Widerstandskräfte wecken. Um zu beweisen, dass er seine Furcht überwunden hat, kauft er Coppola ein Perspektiv ab, durch welches er aber, als er das erste Mal hindurchsieht, den Automaten-Menschen Olimpia zeigt. Er vergisst daraufhin Clara, aber als er durch einen Streit zwischen Coppola und einem seiner Mitarbeiter erfährt, dass Olimpia nur eine ""leblose Puppe"" ist, wird er wahnsinnig. Clara pflegt ihn gesund, jedoch als er mit ihr zusammen einen Turm besteigt und sein Blick nochmals durch das Perspektiv wirft, wird er erneut wahnsinnig, versucht Clara vom Turm zu schubsen und stürzt sich danach selbst herab. Sigmund Freud analysiert den ""Sandmann"" in seinem Essay ""Das Unheimliche"". Die daraus entstehende und breit geführte Diskussion macht Hoffmanns erstes ""Nachtstück"" zu einem seiner meist besprochenen Erzählungen.",Literary Criticism / European / German,German,2017-10-29 19:18:20,2017-10-29 19:18:20,953939196a68ffe465ca1dbea636fd16

By 1978 he was the biggest concert draw in the history of stand-up. In 1981 he quit forever. This book is, in his own words, the story of ""why I did stand-up and why I walked away."" <br /><br />Emmy and Grammy Award winner, author of the acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>Shopgirl</i> and <i>The Pleasure of My Company</i>, and a regular contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>, Martin has always been a writer. His memoir of his years in stand-up is candid, spectacularly amusing, and beautifully written. <br /><br />At age ten Martin started his career at Disneyland, selling guidebooks in the newly opened theme park. In the decade that followed, he worked in the Disney magic shop and the Bird Cage Theatre at Knott's Berry Farm, performing his first magic/comedy act a dozen times a week. The story of these years, during which he practiced and honed his craft, is moving and revelatory. The dedication to excellence and innovation is formed at an astonishingly early age and never wavers or wanes. <br /><br />Martin illuminates the sacrifice, discipline, and originality that made him an icon and informs his work to this day. To be this good, to perform so frequently, was isolating and lonely. It took Martin decades to reconnect with his parents and sister, and he tells that story with great tenderness. Martin also paints a portrait of his times-the era of free love and protests against the war in Vietnam, the heady irreverence of <i>The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour</i> in the late sixties, and the transformative new voice of <i>Saturday Night Live</i> in the seventies.<br /><br />Throughout the text, Martin has placed photographs, many never seen before. <i>Born Standing Up</i> is a superb testament to the sheer tenacity, focus, and daring of one of the greatest and most iconoclastic comedians of all time.",,English,2017-10-29 19:29:34,2017-10-29 19:29:34,e5b2d9eb493b53c86897ab77b4b0e44e

If bestselling books are advising us to not think, LeGault argues, it comes as no surprise that sharp, incisive reasoning has become a lost art in the daily life of people everywhere. <br /><br /> Somewhere along the line, the Age of Reason morphed into the Age of Emotion; this systemic erosion is costing time, money, jobs, and lives in the twenty-first century, leading to less fulfilment and growing dysfunction. LeGault provides a bold, controversial, and objective analysis of the causes and solutions for some of the biggest problems facing Western culture in the 21st century.

Why are some people brilliant decision makers, while others are consistently inept? Why do some people follow their instincts and win, while others end up stumbling into error?

And why are the best decisions often those that are impossible to explain to others?<p>In <i>Blink</i> we meet the psychologist who has learned to predict whether a marriage will last, based on a few minutes of observing a couple; the tennis coach who knows when a player will double-fault before the racket even makes contact with the ball; the antiquities experts who recognize a fake at a glance. Here, too, are great failures of ""blink"": the election of Warren Harding; ""New Coke""; and the shooting of Amadou Diallo by police. <i>Blink</i> reveals that great decision makers aren't those who process the most information or spend the most time deliberating, but those who have perfected the art of ""thin-slicing""--filtering the very few factors that matter from an overwhelming number of variables.<br /><br /><i>Contents</i><br /><br />Introduction: The statue that didn´t look right<br />1.

Over the past two years, she has transformed almost every aspect of her life. She has quit smoking, run a marathon, and been promoted at work. The patterns inside her brain, neurologists discover, have fundamentally changed.<br /> <br />Marketers at Procter &amp; Gamble study videos of people making their beds. They are desperately trying to figure out how to sell a new product called Febreze, on track to be one of the biggest flops in company history. Suddenly, one of them detects a nearly imperceptible pattern—and with a slight shift in advertising, Febreze goes on to earn a billion dollars a year.<br /> <br />An untested CEO takes over one of the largest companies in America. His first order of business is attacking a single pattern among his employees—how they approach worker safety—and soon the firm, Alcoa, becomes the top performer in the Dow Jones.<br /> <br />What do all these people have in common? They achieved success by focusing on the patterns that shape every aspect of our lives. <br /> <br />They succeeded by transforming habits.<br /> <br />In <i>The Power of Habit, </i>award-winning <i>New York Times</i> business reporter Charles Duhigg takes us to the thrilling edge of scientific discoveries that explain why habits exist and how they can be changed. With penetrating intelligence and an ability to distill vast amounts of information into engrossing narratives, Duhigg brings to life a whole new understanding of human nature and its potential for transformation. <br /> <br />Along the way we learn why some people and companies struggle to change, despite years of trying, while others seem to remake themselves overnight. We visit laboratories where neuroscientists explore how habits work and where, exactly, they reside in our brains. We discover how the right habits were crucial to the success of Olympic swimmer Michael Phelps, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, and civil-rights hero Martin Luther King, Jr. We go inside Procter &amp; Gamble, Target superstores, Rick Warren’s Saddleback Church, NFL locker rooms, and the nation’s largest hospitals and see how implementing so-called keystone habits can earn billions and mean the difference between failure and success, life and death.<br /> <br />At its core, <i>The Power of Habit</i> contains an exhilarating argument: The key to exercising regularly, losing weight, raising exceptional children, becoming more productive, building revolutionary companies and social movements, and achieving success is understanding how habits work. <br /> <br />Habits aren’t destiny.

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life-; from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing-; and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives-; how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In ""Freakonomics,"" they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and-; if the right questions are asked-; is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to seethrough all the clutter.<br /><br />""Freakonomics"" establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But ""Freakonomics"" can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.",,English,2017-10-30 18:05:14,2017-10-30 18:05:14,da33d754a1837e35092416553ceec545

Through the example of four very different cultures that have the distinction of producing some of the world’s healthiest, oldest people, Robbins reveals the secrets for living an extended and fulfilling life in which our later years become a period of wisdom, vitality, and happiness. From Abkhasia in the Caucasus south of Russia, where age is beauty, and Vilcabamba in the Andes of South America, where laughter is the greatest medicine, to Hunza in Central Asia, where dance is ageless, and finally the southern Japanese islands of Okinawa, the modern Shangri-la, where people regularly live beyond a century, Robbins examines how the unique lifestyles of these peoples can influence and improve our own.<br /><br />Bringing the traditions of these ancient and vibrantly healthy cultures together with the latest breakthroughs in medical science, Robbins reveals that, remarkably, they both point in the same direction. The result is an inspirational synthesis of years of research into healthy aging in which Robbins has isolated the characteristics that will enable us to live long and–most important–joyous lives. With an emphasis on simple, wholesome, but satisfying fare, and the addition of a manageable daily exercise routine, many people can experience great improvement in the quality of their lives now and for many years to come. But perhaps more surprising is Robbins’ discovery that it is not diet and exercise alone that helps people to live well past one hundred. The quality of personal relationships is enormously important. With startling medical evidence about the effects of our interactions with others, Robbins asserts that loneliness has more impact on lifespan than such known vices as smoking. There is clearly a strong beneficial power to love and connection.<br /><br />“We all have the tools to live longer lives, and to remain active, productive, and resourceful until the very end,” Robbins writes. <i>Healthy at 100</i> strives to improve both the quality and the quantity of our remaining years–no matter how old or how healthy we might currently be–and to reverse the social stigma on aging. After reading this book, we will never think about age–or life–in the same way again.<br /><br />“John Robbins has inspired millions of people with his eloquent, clear, compassionate, and insightful guidance on the path to health and fulfillment. Healthy at 100 may be his finest work to date. If you are interested in extending your health span as well as your life span, read this book! Healthy at 100 is a masterpiece.”<br />–Dean Ornish, M.D., president and director of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, author of <i>Dr. Dean Ornish’s Program for Reversing Heart Disease</i><br /><br />“This is a remarkably open and heartfelt book full of wisdom and love by an extraordinary man who has been teaching us how to live more healthy and compassionate lives for over twenty years now. John Robbins has created a new vision of aging for American society.”<br />–John Mackey, CEO, <i>Whole Foods</i><br /><br />“John Robbins is one of the most important voices in America today. He cuts through nonsense like no one else does. He gives hope like no one else does. His words are lifelines for both the body and soul.

Two hundred years ago, when the United States and Canada were home to less than 5 million people, they were also home to some 650 species of birds. Today, more than 280 million people live there, and 33 bird species have already been driven to extinction and well over 150 are in danger of extinction in all or parts of their range. This book, organized and written by the authors of The Birder's Handbook, and enriched by 191 strikingly beautiful color paintings illustrating all of the birds treated, is the first concise, authoritative review of the status of the birds currently imperiled in the United States and Canada - those that are federally listed as Endangered or Threatened and those that are listed by the National Audubon Society as suffering local or regional or widespread decline. It also treats the birds that have been driven to extinction in the past two centuries, since the stories of their somber fates can help us learn how to save the other birds that are in jeopardy. Because birdwatchers and others are showing increased interest in the tropical birds that survive in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, the book includes separate sections on the imperiled and extinct birds of those areas. Hawaii is of special importance: because it has seen so many extinctions just in the years since Cook's arrival (23 species and subspecies), it provides a laboratory for studying the impact of civilization on birds in the wild. The individual texts - written in clear, non-technical language - cover requirements for successful nesting andfeeding; worldwide and North American breeding range, wintering range, and imperiled portions of range; current population estimates (for Threatened and Endangered birds); behavioral and other factors pertinent to conservation; former and/or current threats associated with decline",,English,2017-10-30 23:58:14,2017-10-30 23:58:14,58235de4eadae06ee6e6870f92a94323
